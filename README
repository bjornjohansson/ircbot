This is an IRC-bot suitable for use on private networks with trusted users.
The bot has something called "triggers". A trigger is a regular expression
and a reply. For each line of input on an IRC channel each trigger will
examine the line using the regular expression. If there is a match the reply
will be invoked. The reply can be just a text reply, execution of a command,
triggering another trigger and so on. The fact that a reply may include
execution of a command means that this is the biggest security hole in the
history of mankind. Do not run this on untrusted networks or with untrusted
users.

There is also something called "reminders". The bot keeps track of times
when it should produce a particular output.

Another feature is input through a named pipe. Messages can be sent from
external sources through a named pipe to a particular user or channel. This
is useful for things like cron jobs that can provide external input, such
as RSS feeds.

The bot itself is not really very useful, instead it's whatever support
built around it using triggers and the named pipe that can make it useful.
